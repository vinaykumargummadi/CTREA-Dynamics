Problem Statement
Connecticut, the southernmost state in the New England region of the Northeastern United
States confronts a complex array of challenges and opportunities in its dynamic real estate
landscape. Positioned strategically in proximity to major urban centres like New York City and
Boston grapples with evolving real estate dynamics. The resurgence of in-person work and
inflation's impact on affordability redefine housing demands. Balancing the needs of a returning
workforce and addressing inflationary pressures pose challenges. Esteemed educational
institutions, including Yale University, contribute to continuous housing demand.
Ongoing infrastructure developments offer opportunities but require careful planning to avoid
affordability issues and displacement. Low inventory, rising demand, and a positive job market
further complicate the real estate landscape. Strategic interventions are essential to navigate
these complexities, ensuring sustainable solutions that cater to diverse housing needs while
maintaining the state's unique character.

Introduction
Within Connecticut's real estate sphere, the interplay of escalating prices, limited inventory,
and a strategic location near major urban centres and prestigious academic institutions has
created a multifaceted challenge. The heightened demand, fueled by proximity to New York
and Boston, Yale University's influence, and ongoing federal infrastructure projects,
introduces a scenario where potential real estate investors face uncertainties. This
uncertainty is exacerbated by factors such as soaring inflation rates and constrained
inventory.
In response to these challenges, the application of advanced data science techniques,
particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models, emerges as a pivotal
solution. By scrutinizing publicly available real estate sales data, these models can uncover
intricate patterns and discern consumer behaviour. This, in turn, empowers buyers to make
well-informed decisions amidst a dynamic market environment.
The accessibility of real estate sales data shared by the US government serves as a
cornerstone for this initiative. ML and DL models, by delving deeper into this data, not only
equip buyers with strategic insights but also provide valuable assistance to state
governments. The understanding of consumer behaviour and the intricate dynamics
influencing the market allows for the formulation of policies that effectively manage inflation
and foster stability in property prices. Through this data-driven approach, we aim to cultivate
a resilient and consumer-centric real estate landscape in Connecticut.
